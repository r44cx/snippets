This command is used to run git gc (garbage collection) on all .git directories within the current directory.

find is a command-line utility that searches for files and directories within a specified location.

The options used in the command are:

`.` This option specifies the current directory as the location to search for files and directories.

`-name '*.git'` This option tells find to search for directories that match the pattern *.git.

`-execdir sh -c 'cd {} && git gc' \;` This option tells find to execute the specified shell command sh -c 'cd {} && git gc' for each *.git directory found, using the directory containing the *.git directory as the current directory (-execdir). The {} in the shell command is a placeholder for the path of each *.git directory. The cd {} part changes to the directory containing the *.git directory, and git gc performs garbage collection on the Git repository within that directory. The \; at the end of the command is necessary to correctly terminate the -execdir option.

```
find . -name '*.git' -execdir sh -c 'cd {} && git gc' \;
```
